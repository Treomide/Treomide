- 👋 Hi, I’m @Treomide, but my full name is Ljupche Zvezdakoski, Treomide was originally used just as a
GamerTag but now it's a great part of my life. Most likely since I spent quite of my time doing just that.

-  👀 I’m interested in coding in general but my hobbies are much broader and consist of creating projects,
both virtual and physical (virtual in the means of programs/software/websites and physical as in building the very desk and chair I use to doing the first ones haha!),
chess, watching "Outdoors Boys", cooking, excercising and what not. I really regard myself as a Jack of all traits but master at none (yet?).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data engineering with Python mainly, but I have subjects in Uni where I use C, C++, HTML & CSS, JavaScript and I am still
trying to broaden my knowledge in other languages and their use.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I love new stuff and no matter how hard they seem at first I am always determined to reach the best solution.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I really like latinas
